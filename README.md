# ShooterGame

A little lab on the Shooter Game example on Epic Store.

I implemented three custom mechanics:

- **Teleport**: T Key || B button - The player will be teleported 10 meters forward its position
- **Jetpack**: Y key || X button - The player will receive a jetpack boost in the direction its moving
- **Wall Run**: hold space bar || hold X button against a wall - The player will run on the wall, it will be able to jump from wall to wall
